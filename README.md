# OVARC TASK

## Tech Stack

- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server.
- **React Router**: Dynamic routing with code splitting.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Build for production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Features

1. **Shop Page**:

    It has a list of cards containing the book cover page, title & author, and which stores this book is available in. The sell button should mark this as sold but keep the card on the page.

2. **Authors Page**

    It has a simple list of authors and two CTAs to edit the name (in-line edit) or delete the author entirely. There is a CTA & a modal too for adding a new author.

3. **Books Page**

    It has a list of books, the number of pages, and who the author is. The edit CTA is an in-line edit for the book title.

4. **Stores Page**

    Same as the above two. The entire row is a CTA for the next page.

5. **Store Inventory Page**

    This is where the admin adds more books to the store’s
    inventory. The books should be viewable either in a list view or grouped by the author via the tab selection. The add to inventory CTA pops up a modal to select the new book and set its price.
